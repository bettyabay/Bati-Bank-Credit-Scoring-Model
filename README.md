# Integrated Credit Risk Modeling and Loan Optimization with Advanced Segmentation

This project focuses on leveraging advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques to develop a comprehensive credit risk assessment, credit scoring, and loan optimization framework. The system is designed to support a Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) service offered by a financial service provider in partnership with an eCommerce company. The primary objectives include customer segmentation, credit risk modeling, and loan optimization.

## Project Objectives

### 1. Customer Segmentation
- **Objective:** Conduct in-depth customer segmentation using RFMS (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value, and Standard Deviation of Amount Spent) scores.
- **Purpose:** Classify customers into high-risk and low-risk segments to tailor the BNPL or loan service offerings.

### 2. Credit Risk Modeling
- **Objective:** Develop machine learning models to predict credit risk and default probabilities.
- **Outcome:** Provide a risk probability for each customer, aiding in the assessment of creditworthiness and default risk.
- **Credit Score Model:** Create a credit score model based on risk probabilities, aligned with FICO standards.

### 3. Loan Optimization Model
- **Objective:** Develop a model to determine optimal loan amounts, repayment periods, and other terms.
- **Outcome:** Offer personalized financing options to customers, enhancing the BNPL service's value proposition.

## Methodology

The project integrates supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and clustering algorithms. These models are trained and validated using historical BNPL data and external credit bureau information. The ultimate goal is to embed these models into the BNPL platform, improving credit decision-making, customer satisfaction, and business performance.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing
Gather and preprocess historical BNPL application and repayment data. This includes data cleaning, handling missing values, and normalization.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze customer characteristics, behaviors, and credit profiles to identify patterns influencing credit risk and repayment.

## Feature Engineering
Create new features, including RFMS scores, based on insights from EDA to enhance the models' predictive power.

## Weight of Evidence (WoE) Binning
Apply WoE binning to transform features into a suitable format for machine learning models.

## Feature Selection
Select the most relevant features using techniques like correlation analysis and recursive feature elimination.

## Model Development
Develop various machine learning models to predict credit risk, score, and loan optimization metrics.

- **Model 1:** Gradient Boosting - Predictive Credit Risk probability estimator model.
- **Model 2:** Linear Regression - Credit score model from risk probability estimates.

## Model Deployment and Integration
Deploy the selected models into the BNPL platform to enhance decision-making processes.

## Monitoring and Continuous Improvement
Continuously monitor and refine the models to ensure they maintain high accuracy and effectiveness over time.
